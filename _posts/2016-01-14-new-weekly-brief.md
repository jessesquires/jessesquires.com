In case you are [late to the party](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires/status/687457899992383488), I finally found some time to give the *Swift Weekly Brief* a proper home. Starting this newsletter kind of happened by accident when I [first wrote]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-12-06-swift-open-source %}) about the Swift open source announcement. Since then, it was kind of bootstrapped here on my personal blog and started to feel awkward. I hacked together [the new site](http://swiftweekly.github.io) in a couple of nights and moved all the previous posts over. Today's [issue #5](http://swiftweekly.github.io/issue-5/) is the first one to be originally published at [swiftweekly.github.io](http://swiftweekly.github.io). However, there is more here than just organization and a nice separation of concerns.

### Openness

I wanted the site to be as open and accessible as possible. It is setup has a GitHub [organization](https://github.com/SwiftWeekly), hosted on [GitHub-Pages](https://pages.github.com), and built completely with open source tools and libraries &mdash; [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), [jQuery](http://jquery.com), and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).

### Community

With this setup, anyone can quickly and easily contribute fixes, corrections, suggestions, or content. I would much rather describe this as __*our*__ newsletter, not __*my*__ newsletter. One thing I always liked about [NSHipster](http://nshipster.com) and [objc.io](https://www.objc.io/issues/) were the guest writers &mdash; it's a great way to get other (and perhaps lesser known) members of the community involved. So if you would like to contribute, don't be shy and [let me know](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires)!
