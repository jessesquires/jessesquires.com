I'm incredibly happy and incredibly proud to share that [Rosetta Stone](http://www.rosettastone.com) is an [open-source software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) contributor. Since I started working at Rosetta Stone a little more than a year ago, I've been encouraging and advocating for the company to get involved in open-source. Today, we did just that. Today is a big day for Rosetta Stone.

See [my post](http://product.rosettastone.com/rosetta-stone-is-now-on-github/) on our product/engineering [blog](http://product.rosettastone.com/news/) for the official announcement. I think the [value](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html) and [benefits](http://ashfurrow.com/blog/sharing-is-selfish/) of open-source are clear, and immeasurable. Every great engineer that I know agrees. So I couldn't be more excited about this news.

And to top it off, I helped author our *first* **ever** open-source project! Today we released an initial version of [RSTCoreDataKit](https://github.com/rosettastone/RSTCoreDataKit), an iOS library for making [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/cdProgrammingGuide.html) easier to use. This is just a start and there's certainly more coming. This is only the beginning.

Now go show us some love on [GitHub](https://github.com/rosettastone).
