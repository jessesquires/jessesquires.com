title: Built with open-source
subtitle: The beginnings of this blog

XKCD's posts on [saving time](http://xkcd.com/1205/) and [automation](http://xkcd.com/1319/) are precisely how this blog came to be. Until now, I never had the time or motivation to write on a regular basis, though I considered it often. I've been developing for iOS for a few years now and I've become increasingly involved in the Objective-C open-source community via [GitHub](https://github.com/jessesquires) and [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), and was lucky enough to attend (*my first!*) [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc) this year on its 25th anniversary. It was an awesome experience. With that said, I can't think of a better time or better reason to begin writing about my experiences with iOS and Objective-C (and now [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)), as well as my involvement in open-source. I hope to share worthwhile and interesting things here.

### This site

For this site, I did not want a *blogspot* or *tumblr* or *wordpress* site. I wanted to build a site and manage it myself. I wanted control and I wanted it to be made as simple as possible, [but no simpler](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein). And I wanted it to be open-source.

This site is lovingly powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), and it is generously hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) &mdash; *all of which are built on and influenced by open-source*.

### Open-source

This world would be significantly different without the concept of [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), which is an idea that has been around for millenia. Though it was not always referred to as "open-source", the core ideas persist. Only through the processes of sharing, [collaboration](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/origins/2009/09/on-the-origin-of-cooperation.html), and [reciprocity](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130820094643.htm) did our ancestors establish a stable, thriving society. It is this kind of openness and cooperation that has fostered our thriving community of programmers. Whether or not we can describe it as [*stable*](http://heartbleed.com), I'll leave up to you. Nearly all of the software in-use today was built on, supported by, or influenced by [**open-source software**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software). It would be naive to think that the different technologies and apps that we take for granted every single day would be here without that help.

**Future posts will focus on iOS, Cocoa, Objective-C, Swift, and open-source.**
