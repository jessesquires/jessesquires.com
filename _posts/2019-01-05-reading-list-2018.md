title: A list of books I read in 2018
---

Here’s the list of the books I read in 2018. There are 36 in total. At first it seemed like a small number to me. However, that averages to three books per month, which actually feels like a lot. In fact, I'm not sure I *could read more* than three books each month. There was never a time last year when I wasn't reading something, and I often read multiple books at once.

<!--excerpt-->

There is no particular order. They are grouped roughly by genre/topic and books by the same author are grouped together. There are no links to Amazon ([because](https://reallifemag.com/the-constant-consumer/) [fuck](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-delivery-drivers-reveal-claims-of-disturbing-work-conditions-2018-8) [Amazon](https://gizmodo.com/amazons-aggressive-anti-union-tactics-revealed-in-leake-1829305201)) or other major booksellers because I do not want to endorse any of them. The only exception is for small, independent publishers that I think we should support. Like [PM Press](http://www.pmpress.org), which is based in Oakland. Some of these are freely available online, and I’ve linked to them accordingly.

##### The Authors

One of my goals was to read more books by non-male and non-white authors. Of the 36 books, there were 20 unique authors. Here is the breakdown:

- 13 male-identifying (65%)
- 7 female-identifying (35%)
- 1 anonymous (CrimethInc)
- 9 people of color / non-white (45%)

However, I read multiple books by the same author. Here's the breakdown in terms of the 36 total books:

- 24 male-identifying (66%)
- 12 female-identifying (33%)
- 1 anonymous (CrimethInc)
- 18 people of color / non-white (50%)

##### What's next?

For this year, I want to continue reading more diverse authors, more fiction, and more books on radical politics and philosophy.

I recommend all of the books listed above. This is my first post like this. I only started tracking my reading in 2017. I wish I had started keeping these lists and writing these posts sooner. But, you have to start somewhere I suppose. I look forward to writing another one of these at the end of 2019.
