Last week I attended and [gave a talk](https://speakerdeck.com/jessesquires/140-proposals-in-30-minutes) at [FrenchKit](http://frenchkit.fr) in Paris, France. As expected, it was an amazing conference &mdash; especially considering it was the first FrenchKit ever. I think the organizers are already thinking about FrenchKit 2017, so keep an eye out and definitely go if you can. I know I will.

### Talk

The slides from my talk are [on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/jessesquires/140-proposals-in-30-minutes) and the project mentioned in the talk is [on GitHub](https://github.com/jessesquires/swift-proposal-analyzer). I'll be writing another, in-depth post on the `swift-proposal-analyzer` next.

### Highlights

I'm not sure if I could articulate this better than [Rob Napier](https://twitter.com/cocoaphony), so just [read his post](http://robnapier.net/copying), and mentally paste it here. &#x1F604; Always, these indie conferences are about the people &mdash; and the people at FrenchKit were awesome. We do not often have the opportunity to meet people from our community face-to-face, so it's a special occasion when we do.

Aside from the fantastic lineup of [speakers](http://frenchkit.fr/#programme), I got to meet Bas Broek ([**@basthomas**](https://twitter.com/BasThomas)) who has been contributing to [Swift Weekly Brief](http://swiftweekly.github.io), as well as SÃ©bastien Duperron ([**@liquidseb**](https://twitter.com/liquidseb)) who contributed significantly to [JSQCoreDataKit](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQCoreDataKit) (which I [wrote about]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2016-05-22-open-source-everything %}) before). There were many other great folks (including a few users of [JSQMessages](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController)), but definitely too many to list here.

The organizers opened with a mock Apple-esque keynote. It was hilarious and I hope this part was also recorded. The conference closed with &#x1F9C0; and &#x1F377; (of course) and a fun pub quiz. We had a good time with lots of laughs.

### Thanks

I can't say thank you enough to [Simone](https://twitter.com/viteinfinite), [Michel](https://twitter.com/guilletmichel), [Nicolas](https://twitter.com/nlauquin), [Mathieu](https://twitter.com/MonsieurDart), and everyone at [Xebia](https://twitter.com/XebiaFr) who helped make this conference great for everyone. Until we meet again, let's keep chatting on Twitter and coding together on GitHub.
