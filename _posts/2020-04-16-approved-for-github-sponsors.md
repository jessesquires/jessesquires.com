I am happy to share that I was just approved for [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors). You can now [support my open source work](https://github.com/sponsors/jessesquires) and GitHub will [match contributions for the first year](https://help.github.com/en/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-the-github-sponsors-matching-fund).

As you may know, I went independent at the end of last year to pursue my own apps and other projects (mostly) full-time. While doing this, I am currently doing contract work part-time to sustain myself financially.

I will continue blogging and I plan to open source a majority of my work as I complete it. And of course, I will continue contributing to other open source projects. If you read my blog or use one of my libraries, consider [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/jessesquires). Your support is appreciated!
