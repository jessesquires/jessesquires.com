title: Adapting to change
subtitle: And cutting corners
---

In my [previous post]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2017-02-10-refactoring-singletons-in-swift %}) I mentioned writing *adaptive* code. That is to say, writing code that is easy to change, code that is malleable. It's like creating [adaptive user interfaces]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2014-10-01-adaptive-user-interfaces %}) but for all of your classes, modules, and other components.

Software evolves too rapidly to predict. We cannot always foresee the changes we will need to make to accommodate new features or fix systemic bugs. What we can do is avoid backing ourselves into a corner, locking the door, and throwing away the key. We can avoid situations where the only (seemingly) viable solution is to destroy everything and [start from scratch](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/).

To [make progress](http://robnapier.net/refactoring) and actually ship code, you *will* have to cut corners. Sometimes you will have to cut a lot of them. Some corners can easily be cut, while others should **never** be cut. Those are the corners that back you into a corner from which you cannot escape.

No one has a [perfect and pure object graph](https://twitter.com/sqlabs/status/789127047922774016) with perfectly modularized components. That is for what we strive, constantly [refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html). The more code we write, the more code we ship, and the more mistakes we make, the better our corner-cutting strategies and backed-into-a-corner-avoiding abilities will become. It takes a lot of shitty code and many bad ideas to finally arrive at slightly better code and a few great ideas.
