Do you love writing code? Are you passionate about open source? Do you want to get more involved, but have yet to find a project to which you want contribute? Are you interested in contributing to a widely used, impactful project? Then I have a proposition for you! 😄 I am looking for dedicated core contributors to help maintain [JSQMessagesViewController](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController)!

### 3 years later

Believe it or not, `1.0.0` was released [3 years ago](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController/releases/tag/1.0.0)! It really is surprising how much the project has evolved and changed since then.

Don't worry &mdash; I still plan to play a large role in the development of the library that we have all grown to love, but I am realizing that I do not have enough hours each month to move as fast as I would like. **JSQMessages is not being abandoned.** But, I want to move faster. **You** can help this project *move faster*.

### Impact

Contributing to open source is extremely rewarding and provides you with an opportunity to **give back**. If you are reading this, it is nearly impossible for you to not have benefited from open source in *some way*. You might even use JSQMessages. 😄 Working on this library will give you a chance to work on a high profile, high impact project for the iOS community. Not to mention, you will learn a lot! And it will be fun! 🤓

If you aren't convinced, here's some data to help!

* **Over [5,500 apps are using this library](https://cocoapods.org/pods/JSQMessagesViewController)**
* It has [100% documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/JSQMessagesViewController/)
* It has decent [test coverage](https://codecov.io/github/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController) and [continuous integration](https://travis-ci.org/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController)
* There's a nice [roadmap](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController/issues/1216) and [milestones](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController/milestones)
* Over 7,000 stars and over 1,600 forks [on GitHub](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController)
