I'm an independent software developer in Oakland, California. I use [he/him](https://pronoun.is/he) pronouns. While primarily an iOS and macOS developer, I do have other programming interests. You can learn about my [open source work and side projects here]({% link projects.md %}), and you can find a list of my [conference talks here]({% link speaking.md %}). I'm currently working on [indie projects](https://www.hexedbits.com), as well as [freelancing and contracting]({% link hire-me.md %}) for iOS. Previously, I have worked at various different companies, which you can find on my [CV here]({% link linkedout.md %}).

Regarding work, I'm interested in contributing to and writing software that is useful, meaningful, and prioritizes the privacy and needs of its users rather than the interests of predatory corporations, greedy investors, and government surveillance agencies. I have no interest in working on software that is privacy-invasive, or user-hostile. I have no interest in working on software that undermines workers' rights, or facilitates war.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, tea and coffee, traveling, and taking care of my plants. When I'm not running trails or riding my bike, you can likely find me at punk, hardcore, and metal shows in the Bay Area.
