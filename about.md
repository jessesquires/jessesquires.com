---

I'm a software developer in Oakland, California. I'm primarily an iOS developer, though I have other programming interests. My open source projects are on [GitHub]({{ site.social_links.github}}) and my iOS libraries are on [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/owners/1808). My side projects can be found at [Hexed Bits](https://hexedbits.com). I curate the [Swift Weekly Brief](https://swiftweekly.github.io) newsletter and co-host the [Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped) podcast. I'm currently an iOS developer at [PlanGrid](https://plangrid.com). Previously, I've worked at [Instagram](https://instagram.com) and [Rosetta Stone](https://rosettastone.com).

Outside of programming, my interests include cognitive science, philosophy, and avant-garde art. I drink coffee *and* tea. I enjoy barefoot trail running and body modification. You can often find me at punk, hardcore, and metal shows in the Bay Area. I hope to contribute to a society that values community over hierarchy, [self-determination over capitalist exploitation](https://crimethinc.com/tce), and public ownership over private property.
