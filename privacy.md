This website implements simple, privacy-aware analytics via [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com), which is [100% open source](https://github.com/zgoat/goatcounter) like the rest of [this website]({{ site.links.github }}). No personal information is collected and no data is shared with third parties. You can view GoatCounter's full [privacy policy here](https://www.goatcounter.com/privacy) which details exactly what (non-identifiable) information is collected.

In the spirit of openness, all of the analytics data is open source, too. You can view it yourself at [stats.jessesquires.com](https://stats.jessesquires.com). This data is exactly what I see. The only limitation of this public view is that it updates once per hour instead of in real time.

If you would like to learn more, you can [read my blog post]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2020-05-08-simple-private-opensource-analytics-with-goatcounter %}).
